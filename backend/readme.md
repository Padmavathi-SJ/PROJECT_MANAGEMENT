--> now need to write a model, controller and router to acheive the below operation.
--> The idea is a student can apply for challenge review for only one time for a semester, those requests are stored in the above table---> these feilds already done and also attatched below for your reference.
--> the request details (cluster wise, review_type --> students(challenge review requests) count) will be fetched and display detaily for admin --> then admin will assign reviewers --> 'pmc1', 'pmc2' to conduct challenge reviews as by "ratio" --> like 5(students/challenge review requests count) : 1(pmc1, pmc2) --> for  5 students 1 pmc1, 1 pmc2.
--> here pmc1 and pmc2 are staffs from the clusters.
--> pmc1 and pmc2 both should be assigned automatically from same cluster in which cluster requested student is done their project.
--> this ratio type is to reduce workload of assigning for each and individual student.
--> case: 1 --> if toal count is 7 in EEE, admin is giving ratio as 5:1, balance is 2 --> for that 2 students admin need to give the ratio again like 2:1 --> because admin known bal is 2 so directly admin can give the ratio 2:1.
---> Admin no need to assign manually for any student.
---> then need to write a sql query to create a table to store these challenge_review_reviewers_assignment with feilds --> semester, team_id, project_id, project_type, review_type, student_reg_num, pmc1_reg_num, pmc2_reg_num.
--> then respective pmc1, pmc2 will get the notifications--> they will schedule the review --> then will update marks -> these fields will be implemented later.
--> now clearly implement model, controller and router to perform the above challenge review process.
